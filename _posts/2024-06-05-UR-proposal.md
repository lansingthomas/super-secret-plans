# user testing plan for remainder of 2024

If there are issues or victories with the interaction {work process realities, mental-models, ...} we should know.

## population
We have tested current users and donors
 in the past. This is a self selecting minority group of people who made it through the gauntlet of installation and user activation (in some cases). We asked why they donate, and tried to understand what feature set or product vision would attract them.

- > "The features are already there for what I would use daily. I can invoke functions. I can write my own functions. There is a config file for me to change." ~GÃ¡bor (from previous cohort, devops for a big telecom company)

This next round of UR should be working developers and students using Nyxt for the first time.

## research objectives and questions from last time
- Why do people donate to Nyxt?
	- Perhaps the feature set matches with what they want
		
	- Perhaps the product vision matches closely with their worldview. (FOSS, paying for independent software)

## research objectives and questions for this time
- how challenging is it to complete the key actions?
- are there other key actions we should be paying attention to?
- Are there issues with the Nyxt interaction {work process realities, mental-models, ...} we should know about?
- What are the small victories that drive people to continue deeper into Nyxt?
- what are the real pre-requisites for someone to get some value out of our product?
- What else do we think might be compelling about Nyxt for this group of people?

## Test protocol
> determining the ease of use for processes that lead to user activation (% of new users who experience value) (our established metric of importance)

### specific users (we want potential users who meet our pre-requisites)
- CMU HCI Students
- Working developers
### testing some task (or group of tasks to user activation)
- pass-fail
- time-to-completion
- talk out loud
- final comments
- sum score
### results
- score totals
- observations
- direct quotes
- mismatches between expectation and reality

- [ ] are the `key actions` as good as we can make them today?
- [ ] who else might be in our target group? (linux only, or wait for mac?)
